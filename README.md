This is a minimal web app written in TypeScript.

How to run:

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# build and serve (one-liner)
npm start

# or build only
npm run build

# or development (watch TS -> run in another terminal: `npx serve -s .`)
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 (or the port printed by `serve`).
